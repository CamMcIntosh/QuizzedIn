# Potential Site Changes  

### UI Changes
- Page contents underflow the nav bar on all pages
- Clicking the SignIn or SignUp buttons should dismiss the popup


### Functionality Changes
Create a quiz page should ask user for the quiz name and category, and the first question. There should be a submit button and a button to add a question.  
The add a question button should show essentially the same page as before, but you can only input another question, not change the quiz name and category.  
The user should be able to add questions (up to a certain limit, probably) until they hit submit and finalize the quiz.
